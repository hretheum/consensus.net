## 🎯 Overview

ConsensusNet is an innovative multi-agent AI system that leverages collective intelligence to combat misinformation. By orchestrating specialized AI agents in adversarial debates and consensus mechanisms, it achieves unprecedented accuracy in fact-checking.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Agent Spawning**: Meta-agents create specialized verifiers on-demand
- **Adversarial Verification**: Prosecutor/Defender agents actively challenge claims  
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Robust consensus even with unreliable agents
- **Trust Networks**: Graph-based reputation system for agent credibility
- **Real-time Processing**: WebSocket support for live verification updates

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hretheum/consensus.net
cd consensus.net

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start development server
docker-compose up -d
python src/main.py
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

ConsensusNet implements ECAMAN (Emergent Consensus through Adversarial Meta-Agent Networks):

```
Meta-Agent Orchestrator
    ↓ spawns
Specialized Agents → Adversarial Debates → Trust-Weighted Consensus
```
