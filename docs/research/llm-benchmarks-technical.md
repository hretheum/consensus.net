## Overview

This document provides detailed technical benchmarks and testing results for LLM candidates evaluated for ConsensusNet's fact-checking system. The benchmarks focus on reasoning capabilities, accuracy, and performance characteristics specific to verification tasks.

## 1. Fact-Checking Benchmark Dataset

### 1.1 Test Claims (Sample)

We evaluated LLM performance on a curated set of 100 fact-checking scenarios across different categories:

#### Scientific Claims (25 claims)
- "The speed of light in vacuum is approximately 300,000 km/s"
- "DNA is composed of four nucleotide bases: A, T, G, and C"
- "Water boils at 100Â°C at sea level atmospheric pressure"

#### Historical Claims (25 claims)  
- "World War II ended in 1945"
- "The Great Wall of China was built primarily during the Ming Dynasty"
- "Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815"

#### Current Events (25 claims)
- "The 2024 Olympics were held in Paris, France"
- "Elon Musk is the CEO of Tesla"
- "The iPhone 15 was released in September 2023"

#### Complex/Nuanced Claims (25 claims)
- "Climate change is primarily caused by human activities"
- "Vaccines are generally safe and effective for preventing diseases"
- "Economic inequality has increased in most developed countries since the 1980s"

### 1.2 Evaluation Metrics

For each claim, we measured:
- **Verdict Accuracy**: Correct TRUE/FALSE/UNCERTAIN classification
- **Reasoning Quality**: Logical coherence and evidence citation (1-5 scale)
- **Confidence Calibration**: How well confidence scores match actual accuracy
- **Response Time**: End-to-end processing duration
- **Token Usage**: Input/output token consumption
